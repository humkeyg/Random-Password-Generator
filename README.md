# Random Password Generator

## Your Task

An application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated

This generator starts by clicking the "generate password" button, which then triggers a series of prompts asking to confirm the number of characters, whether or not to include symbols, lowercase, uppercase, and number characters.

I used javascript functions and if/else to confirm what criteria will be included. I also manually created each option possibility for the number of criteria selected from 1-4 amounts.
