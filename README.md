This generator starts by clicking the "generate password" button, which then triggers a series of prompts asking to confirm the number of characters, whether or not to include symbols, lowercase, uppercase, and number characters.

I used javascript functions and if/else to confirm what criteria will be included. I also manually created each option possibility for the number of criteria selected from 1-4 amounts.
